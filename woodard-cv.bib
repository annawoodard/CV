  abstract={The CMS Remote Analysis Builder (CRAB) is a distributed workflow management tool which facilitates analysis tasks by isolating users from the technical details of the Grid infrastructure. Throughout LHC Run 1, CRAB has been successfully employed by an average of 350 distinct users each week executing about 200,000 jobs per day. CRAB has been significantly upgraded in order to face the new challenges posed by LHC Run 2. Components of the new system include 1) a lightweight client, 2) a central primary server which communicates with the clients through a REST interface, 3) secondary servers which manage user analysis tasks and submit jobs to the CMS resource provisioning system, and 4) a central service to asynchronously move user data from temporary storage in the execution site to the desired storage location. The new system improves the robustness, scalability and sustainability of the service. Here we provide an overview of the new system, operation, and user support, report on its current status, and identify lessons learned from the commissioning phase and production roll-out.}

  abstract={Analysis of high energy physics experiments using the

	    (LHC) can be limited by availability of computing resources.
	    As a joint effort involving computer scientists and CMS
	    physicists at Notre Dame, we have developed an opportunistic
	    workflow management tool, Lobster, to harvest available
	    cycles from university campus computing pools. Lobster
	    consists of a management server, file server, and worker
	    processes which can be submitted to any available computing
	    resource without requiring root access. Lobster makes use of
	    the Work Queue system to perform task management, while the
	    CMS specific software environment is provided via CVMFS and
	    Parrot. Data is handled via Chirp and Hadoop for local data
	    storage and XrootD for access to the CMS wide-area data
	    federation. An extensive set of monitoring and diagnostic
	    tools have been developed to facilitate system optimisation.
	    We have tested Lobster using the 20 000-core cluster at
	    Notre Dame, achieving approximately 8-10k tasks running
	    simultaneously, sustaining approximately 9 Gbit/s of input
	    data and 340 Mbit/s of output data.},

  abstract={The reproducibility of scientific results increasingly depends upon the preservation of computational artifacts. Although preserving a computation to be used later sounds easy, it is surprisingly difficult due to the complexity of existing software and systems. Implicit dependencies, networked resources, and shifting compatibility all conspire to break applications that appear to work well. To investigate these issues, we present a case study of a complex high energy physics application. We analyze the application and attempt several methods at extracting its dependencies for the purposes of preservation. We propose one fine-grained dependency management toolkit to preserve the application and demonstrate its correctness in three different environments - the original machine, one virtual machine from the Notre Dame Cloud Platform and one virtual machine from the Amazon EC2 Platform. We report on the completeness, performance, and efficiency of each technique, and offer some guidance for future work in application preservation.}

The experimental data were compared with expected results based on continuum discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) calculations. The results confirm that it is essential to include continuum-continuum couplings to reproduce the experimental data. The analysis demonstrates that inelastic scattering data can be a critical tool in testing full CDCC calculations involving weakly bound nuclei. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
